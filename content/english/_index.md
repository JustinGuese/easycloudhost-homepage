  heading: "Developers say they spend up to 60% of their time on DevOps instead of the product"
  description: "Instead of focusing on the core business, developers are spending a lot of time on maintenance, deployments and general DevOps. Additionally a lot of new regulations regarding data privacy in Germany and Europe almost forbid the usage of american cloud providers, which can be fined with up to 4% of the yearly revenue of a company if violated."

  - "Serverless hosting of Code - just write your code and 'upload' it. [EasyFAAS]"
  - "Compliance - Our datacenters are located in NÃ¼rnberg and Falkenstein, and therefore out of american reach. Optionally hosting is possible in the US and Finland as well."
  - "Abstraction of Code - We are offering a range of services that each abstract a layer of the DevOps process. Full control? Try EasyKube, our managed Kubernetes platform. Need a managed database? EasyDB. You do not want to have anything to do with DevOps? EasyFAAS is your answer."
