  content: "Justin is a Freelance Data Engineer / Solution Architect working on AWS and Kubernetes projects, where he helped customers to make use of their data. Whilst working on these projects, he soon discovered that a lot of parts were repetitive, and programmed own little helper scripts and SAAS applications to make his life easier. Soon he discovered, that his collection of tools and services could be wrapped into a whole new offering, and help other people struggling with the same problems."
