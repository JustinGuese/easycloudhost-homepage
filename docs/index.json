Next Video: Tech-Demo\n Did you know, that over 60% of development time is spent on DevOp tasks instead of working on the actual product [1]?\n\rWhat if there could be a way to \u0026ldquo;just run code\u0026rdquo; instead of worrying about servers and clusters?\nEasyFAAS (Easy-Function-as-a-service) lets you run your code in an easy environment, without hidden costs.\n  Get Started for free!   Why should I choose EasyFAAS over other providers? Whilst we were working with FAAS services of other providers, we usually ended up having problems with two specific things:\n (EU) Data Security Complexness  1. Our problems with (EU) Data Security Even though FAAS services of other cloud providers are technically secure, they still have the problem of being hosted by an american company. This can be a problem for EU-based companies, as the american \u0026ldquo;patriot act\u0026rdquo; states, that the US government can basically request your data from american companies to \u0026ldquo;intercept and obstruct terrorism\u0026rdquo;. There have been unconfirmed reports of misuse as well, where industry and intellectual secrets were requested.\nThis proves to be especially dangerours for companies in the finance industry, or in general where companies have an intellectual competitive advantage.\n\rOf course no one can surely say (yet) that this is really happening, and that it is not only used for the defeat of terrorism, but our company and many others agree that your data should only belong to you.\n2. Our problems with complexness Now back to a happier topic: The FAAS services of other cloud providers are amazing. They are versatile, well integrated in their system, and were a technological novelty. Our problem has just been, that if you want to \u0026ldquo;just get going\u0026rdquo;, meaning just pasting your code, you will often experience that it is not that easy.\nThe technical interconnections with other services come with a price: You will find yourself setting up API Gateways if you want the service to connect to the outside, where you will need to know about ports, firewalls, security groups and even networking.\nAlso, if you are using custom packages like Python\u0026rsquo;s numpy and pandas, you will have to create an extra layer, which proves to be quite complex, instead of just listing the packages that are used.\nOne of our main applications in the past has been to create little APIs that write and read from a database. In other FAAS solutions, this requires you to create the networking, the database connection and the custom layer to get started, which involved a lot of repetitive tasks.\nIn our EasyFAAS solution this becomes as simple as this:\nContents  Overview Serverless Function Types Managed MongoDB Getting started  EasyFAAS Main Dashboard Creating a new function Code Example: Bitcoin price getter The function Detail page   Billing  Introduction EasyFAAS reduces time to market, and let\u0026rsquo;s your programmers focus on what it important: your code!\nDid you know that you can run one function per month for free? Claim your free function\n\rTo achieve this EasyFAAS currently supports two functions:\n1. Serverless functions  Distinguished into \u0026ldquo;simple\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;storage\u0026rdquo; functions Distinguished into \u0026ldquo;timed\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;continuous\u0026rdquo; functions  2. A managed MongoDB NoSQL database  Easy integration without much setup into your EasyFAAS functions  1. Serverless functions overview A \u0026ldquo;storage\u0026rdquo; function distinguishes itself from a \u0026ldquo;simple\u0026rdquo; function, in that it offers persistence, meaning that if a function crashes, or restarts, that objects saved in the path \u0026quot;/mnt/persistent/\u0026quot; will be saved.\nA \u0026ldquo;timed\u0026rdquo; function distinguishes itself from the \u0026ldquo;continuous\u0026rdquo; function, in that the timed one is running at a specific schedule, whilst the continuous is running constantly.\nThese two settings can be combined, resulting in a total of four combinable possibilities for serverless functions:\n1.1 Simple-Continuous function  Good for web applications that do not require storage. Examples:  you want an API or website displayed where data does not have to be stored you want to download current crypto prices and calculate the exchange rate between two pairs    1.2. Simple-Timed function  Good for jobs that you want to have executed, that do not require storage Examples:  triggering other endpoints with post requests starting external backups downloading data and writing it into the managed MongoDB    1.3. Storage-Continuous function  Good for web applications that require storage. Examples:  An API that receives current users as json and saves them to disk An API or website that needs to save pictures to disk    1.4. Storage-Timed function  Good for jobs that require storage Examples:  You want to download price data every hour and save it into a CSV file You want to create backups of a database    2. Managed MongoDB overview In case storage on disk is not enough, you can easily spin up a managed mongodb instance, which you can easily access from your serverless functions.\nA managed MongoDB makes sense, if you want to run multiple functions that are all accessing the same information, like if you distributed your workloads into several functions, or you are running functions in parallel.\nThe big benefits of the managed MongoDB service are, that contrary to other hosting providers it will remain in a custom network, meaning it is not exposed to the internet, but you can still easily access it in your functions.\nThis means you do not have to worry about SSL connections, strong passwords or other things, and can easily get it up and running in seconds. An example to connect with python is as follows:\nfrom pymongo import MongoClient client = MongoClient(\u0026#39;mongodb://mongodb:27017/\u0026#39;) This saves you from a lot of steps compared to other hosting providers, where you need to set up SSL certificates, ports, firewalls and user password combinations.\nExample applications for the managed MongoDB are:\n You are saving items as json into MongoDB using custom EasyFAAS functions. If one function is not enough, you can simply scale your function up, and the load will be distributed to two functions automatically. You are building an ETL pipeline, where the first function collects data and saves it into the database, the second applies calculations to it and writes it again into the database, and the third one serves the result as an API  1. Getting started EasyFAAS currently only supports Python, but we have Node, React and others already implemented. Tell us about your code preferences and we might be able to get it working.\n\r1.1 The main dashboard Head over to https://app.easyfaas.de/ and register or login.\n  The main dashboard is the central control system for EasyFAAS. In here, you will se an overview over the different services that are available.\n1.2 Create a new function Next click on New function, which takes you to the function type selection screen.\nWhat is a timed, and what is a continuous function?\n\rA timed function is best suited for jobs that do not need to run all the time, but rather run at specific intervals. If you have used Cron in the past, this is pretty much it. You can define Cron schedules as you are used to, like for example    Cron expression   Meaning    30 2 * * * Every day at 2:30   30 * * * * Every day, every hour at :30 (2:30, 3:30, 4:30 ...)   01 2 1 * * 2:01 on the first of every month   I like to use the website https://crontab.guru/ to check my expressions\n\r A continuous function runs all the time, and is best used if you want a webservice or API to run.  \r 1.3 The create function screen For this tutorial I went with a continuous function\nLet us take a look at the differnet elements\n1.3.1 Setup elements Function name\nThis can be whatever you want. The function name will later be converted to a lower-case, \u0026ldquo;-\u0026rdquo; seperated form. Like \u0026ldquo;My awesome FuNcTiOn\u0026rdquo; will become \u0026ldquo;my-awesome-function\u0026rdquo;.\nFunction count\nThis is where scalability comes into play. For now leave function count at 1, but if you later on experience that you need more power, you can easily up-scale your function here.\nPIP requirements\nNow instead of creating a layer for your FAAS function, you can just enter your pip packages here, and it will automatically install them. Easy as that.\nDebian requirements\nAll functions are build in Debian. Meaning you can easily install any Debian package if you need it. If you have installed it on your local system with \u0026ldquo;apt install \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; you can list it here. This is useful if you might need some system based tools like imagemagic, wkhtml and others. This is actually not supported yet in other FAAS services.\nVisibility\nYour EasyFAAS function comes with security enabled by default. If your function is public, it will be accessible for everyone. If it is private, you will need to send an auth token to the endpoint. Does that mean you need to create new users and everything? No, you can just get an auth token using our RestAPI using your normal user and password, and then use that token to fire towards your function. Easy as that.\nFunction type\nThere are different functions to choose from. The selection are simple function and storage function.\nThey are distinguishable in the way, that a storage function has persistence, whilst a normal function has not.\nPersistence means that if your function writes data to the disk, it will be safe.\nDo you write or read from a local file? Like a .csv, or .txt file? Then you will need persistence. If your function just calculates and does not write or read anything, you can choose a simple function\n\rPersistence is enabled at the directory /mnt/persistence/, and not in other directories.\nThis means you can still read and write temporary files in both versions, but only persist them if they are written to the /mnt/persistence path.\n\rNo persistence   with open(\"./tmp.txt\", \"w\") as file: file.write(\"my temporary data\") with open(\"./tmp.txt\", \"r\") as file: data = file.read() #   Persistence at /mnt/persistence/   with open(\"./tmp.txt\", \"w\") as file: file.write(\"my temporary data\") with open(\"./tmp.txt\", \"r\") as file: data = file.read() #   \r 1.3.1 Code This is the core part of your function.\nYour function is using FastAPI in the background, but you do not have to worry about much if you use the already inserted starter code:\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI, Request app = FastAPI()  # basic usage @app.get(\u0026#34;/\u0026#34;) async def root():  return {\u0026#34;message\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Hello World\u0026#34;}  # post requests @app.post(\u0026#34;/\u0026#34;) async def rootPost(request: Request):  data = await request.json()  print(data)  return {\u0026#34;message\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;I got the post: \u0026#34; + str(data)} The EasyFAAS function only supports routing to the root domain \u0026ldquo;/\u0026rdquo;. Meaning if you create different routes they will not be used.\nWhat you can change though, is the request type. It can be GET or POST, as well as the others. For most of the use-cases GET and POST should be enough though.\nIf you want to adapt your code you can easily just add your calculations and functions inside the \u0026ldquo;root\u0026rdquo; function.\nLet us take a look at some examples\nCode example: Bitcoin Price getter  Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.  Previous Video: EasyFAAS Intro\n Let us say you want to create a small route that just returns the current price of Bitcoin. We are using the free coingecko route for it.\nWe will adapt the code to look like this:\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI import requests  base_url = \u0026#34;https://api.binance.com/api/v3\u0026#34;  app = FastAPI()  def getCoingeckoPrice(symbol):  url = base_url + f\u0026#34;/avgPrice?symbol={symbol}USDT\u0026#34;  r = requests.get(url)  return r.json()   # basic usage @app.get(\u0026#34;/\u0026#34;) async def root():  return getCoingeckoPrice(\u0026#34;BTC\u0026#34;) As we want to run this function continuously, and it does not need to save data anywhere, we will choose a continuous and simple function.\nAfter clicking on \u0026ldquo;Deploy\u0026rdquo;, you will be taken back to the mainscreen, where you will see your function.\nThen, click on \u0026ldquo;edit\u0026rdquo; next to you function which will take you to the function detail screen.\nFunction Detail Page We can see a lot of information in here, but let us first just click on the link provided at \u0026ldquo;Link\u0026rdquo;. In this case, it is: https://api.easyfaas.de/functions/route/public/de96cbb3-aead-4485-9889-a76a92a8a719/function-name\nWhen I am clicking on it, it returns:\n{ \u0026#34;status_code\u0026#34;: 200, \u0026#34;status\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ok\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;message\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;{\\\u0026#34;mins\\\u0026#34;: 5, \\\u0026#34;price\\\u0026#34;: \\\u0026#34;19756.28232097\\\u0026#34;}\u0026#34; } The \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; response of our function is located at the message key in the dictionary. Why is that? We want some kind of check if the request was really successful, or if not, some kind of error message.\nSo if your application is querying your EasyFAAS route, it should always check for the \u0026ldquo;status_code\u0026rdquo; part. If the function is failing, it will return for example code 500 together with an error message in the \u0026ldquo;status\u0026rdquo; part.\nAn example on how your application would query the EasyFAAS route is:\nimport requests  response = requests.get(\u0026#34;https://api.easyfaas.de/functions/route/public/de96cbb3-aead-4485-9889-a76a92a8a719/function-name\u0026#34;) if response.status_code != 200:  raise Exception(\u0026#34;error in EasyFAAS function: \u0026#34; + str(response.text)) else:  response = response.json()  message = json.loads(response[\u0026#34;message\u0026#34;])  print(message)  price = float(message[\u0026#34;price\u0026#34;]) Function Detail Page: Logs If you take a closer look at the function detail page you will see a \u0026ldquo;logs\u0026rdquo; section.\nIn here, everything that your function code returns will be shown. If you refresh the page it will refresh the current logs. If you function is not responsive you will see the reason why in here.\nFunction Detail Page: Metrics Metrics show you how much of the resources your function is using. If you require more \u0026ldquo;power\u0026rdquo;, maybe EasyHost or EasyScale is something for you. Otherwise just contact us.\nEasyFAAS billing You might have read the word \u0026ldquo;credits\u0026rdquo; quite often by now. What does it mean?\nEasyFAAS simplifies billing, in that it charges \u0026ldquo;credits\u0026rdquo; instead of usage-based fees. With other cloud providers, you often do not have the full transparency on what will be charged at the end of the month. There are hidden traffic fees, hidden load balancer fees and way more that you can not foresee unless you run the numbers.\nEasyFAAS solves that, in that it simplifies billing to:\n   Function Type Credit cost per Month Euro value     Simple function 1 2€   Storage function 2 4€   Managed MongoDB 5 5€    No hidden fees, no nothing. In future updates we will even include autoscaling based on the remaining credits in your account, meaning that if you have more credits than functions, and a function is close to it\u0026rsquo;s limit, it will scale up to e.g. 2 functions instead of one.\nBilling is done via Stripe, a secure and reliable payment provider.\n Get Started for free!

Inroduction EasyFAAS is an easy way to deploy your code without worrying about hosting, scaling, networking and many other things. Did you know, that around 60% of development time is spent on DevOp operations instead of actually working on the product?\nEasyFAAS reduces time to market, and let\u0026rsquo;s your programmers focus on what it important: your code!\nTo achieve this EasyFAAS currently supports two functions:\n Serverless functions  Distinguished into \u0026ldquo;simple\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;storage\u0026rdquo; functions Distinguished into \u0026ldquo;timed\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;continuous\u0026rdquo; functions   A managed MongoDB NoSQL database  Serverless functions overview A \u0026ldquo;storage\u0026rdquo; function distinguishes itself from a \u0026ldquo;simple\u0026rdquo; function, in that it offers persistence, meaning that if a function crashes, or restarts, that objects saved in the path \u0026quot;/mnt/persistent/\u0026quot; will be saved.\nA \u0026ldquo;timed\u0026rdquo; function distinguishes itself from the \u0026ldquo;continuous\u0026rdquo; function, in that the timed one is running at a specific schedule, whilst the continuous is running constantly.\nThese two settings can be combined, resulting in a total of four combinable possibilities for serverless functions:\n Simple-Continuous function  Good for web applications that do not require storage. Examples:  you want an API or website displayed where data does not have to be stored you want to download current crypto prices and calculate the exchange rate between two pairs     Simple-Timed function  Good for jobs that you want to have executed, that do not require storage Examples:  triggering other endpoints with post requests starting external backups downloading data and writing it into the managed MongoDB     Storage-Continuous function  Good for web applications that require storage. Examples:  An API that receives current users as json and saves them to disk An API or website that needs to save pictures to disk     Storage-Timed function  Good for jobs that require storage Examples:  You want to download price data every hour and save it into a CSV file You want to create backups of a database      Managed MongoDB overview In case storage on disk is not enough, you can easily spin up a managed mongodb instance, which you can easily access from your serverless functions.\nA managed MongoDB makes sense, if you want to run multiple functions that are all accessing the same information, like if you distributed your workloads into several functions, or you are running functions in parallel.\nThe big benefits of the managed MongoDB service are, that contrary to other hosting providers it will remain in a custom network, meaning it is not exposed to the internet, but you can still easily access it in your functions.\nThis means you do not have to worry about SSL connections, strong passwords or other things, and can easily get it up and running in seconds. An example to connect with python is as follows:\nfrom pymongo import MongoClient client = MongoClient(\u0026#39;mongodb://mongodb:27017/\u0026#39;) This saves you from a lot of steps compared to other hosting providers, where you need to set up SSL certificates, ports, firewalls and user password combinations.\nExample applications for the managed MongoDB are:\n You are saving items as json into MongoDB using custom EasyFAAS functions. If one function is not enough, you can simply scale your function up, and the load will be distributed to two functions automatically. You are building an ETL pipeline, where the first function collects data and saves it into the database, the second applies calculations to it and writes it again into the database, and the third one serves the result as an API  1.
