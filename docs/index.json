An example to connect with python is as follows:\nfrom pymongo import MongoClient client = MongoClient(\u0026#39;mongodb://mongodb:27017/\u0026#39;) This saves you from a lot of steps compared to other hosting providers, where you need to set up SSL certificates, ports, firewalls and user password combinations.\nExample applications for the managed MongoDB are:\n You are saving items as json into MongoDB using custom EasyFAAS functions. If one function is not enough, you can simply scale your function up, and the load will be distributed to two functions automatically. You are building an ETL pipeline, where the first function collects data and saves it into the database, the second applies calculations to it and writes it again into the database, and the third one serves the result as an API  1.
